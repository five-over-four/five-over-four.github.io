        <p prompt="Look around.">
        Floating in an endless ocean,
        you awaken to a sense of unreality.
        You feel your way through the stillness.
        A dark fog permeates the air around you.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Approach the wall.">
        You look around in the dreamlike haze,
        for shape and structure. A wall. A room. A door.
        A window with the curtains drawn.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Look outside.">
        You make your way to the wall and pause for a moment.
        </p>

        <p prompt="This feels wrong." prompt2="Step outside.">
        Out of the window, a serene, empty void.
        Out the door, a freezing comfort.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="...">
        The air feels painfully cold.
        It's as if the world ends beyond the threshold.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Go back.">
        There's nothing for you, there.
        There's nothing <i>there</i>.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Yawn.">
        You resist the curiosity and
        close the door.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Sleep.">
        Back inside the room, fatigue overwhelms you.
        </p>

        <p icon="closed.png" prompt="Wake up.">
        ...
        </p>

        <p icon="open.png" prompt="It's too dark.">
        You find yourself, once again, awake.
        Still, the senses blur and the lights feel dim.
        Dimmer than one would think possible.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Find more lights." prompt2="Explore the dark.">
        A couple bulbs illuminate part of the walls.
        You fail to make out any details of the space.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="What's this...?">
        Regardless of how ambiguous the space,
        you're still able to just trace your hand on the wall
        and-
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" effect="lid_close.mp3" prompt="Crouch down to the light.">
        A switch on the wall. Flick it.
        A small light on the floor turns on.
        </p>
        
        <p id="branch1" prompt="&quotFine. I'll look around some more.&quot">
        Next to the light, a metal hatch in the floor.
        On the hatch, a lever.
        Next to the lever, a lock.
        You get the picture.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Keep walking.">
        It is frustratingly dark.
        You feel so tired.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it.">
        You bump into something.
        That something...
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it more.">
        Solid metal.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Wait.">
