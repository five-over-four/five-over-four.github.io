        <p prompt="Begin." icon="open.png" color="#012f33"></p>

        <p prompt="Look around.">
        Floating in an endless ocean,
        you awaken to a sense of unreality.
        You feel your way through the stillness.
        A dark fog permeates the air around you.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Approach the wall.">
        You look around in the dreamlike haze,
        for shape and structure. A wall. A room. A door.
        A window with the curtains drawn.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Look outside.">
        You make your way to the wall and pause for a moment.
        </p>

        <p prompt="This feels wrong." prompt2="Step outside.">
        Out of the window, a serene, empty void.
        Out the door, a freezing comfort.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="...">
        The air feels painfully cold.
        It's as if the world ends beyond the threshold.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Go back.">
        There's nothing for you, there.
        There's nothing <i>there</i>.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Yawn.">
        You resist the curiosity and
        close the door.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Sleep.">
        Back inside the room, fatigue overwhelms you.
        </p>

        <p icon="closed.png" prompt="Wake up.">
        ...
        </p>

        <p icon="open.png" prompt="It's too dark.">
        You find yourself, once again, awake.
        Still, the senses blur and the lights feel dim.
        Dimmer than one would think possible.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Find more lights." prompt2="Explore the dark.">
        A couple bulbs illuminate part of the walls.
        You fail to make out any details of the space.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="What's this...?">
        Regardless of how ambiguous the space,
        you're still able to just trace your hand on the wall
        and-
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Crouch down to the light." effect="lightswitch.mp3">
        A switch on the wall. Flick it.
        A small light on the floor turns on.
        </p>
        
        <p id="branch1" prompt="Get up.">
        Next to the light, a metal hatch in the floor.
        On the hatch, a handle.
        Next to the handle, a lock.
        You try pulling, but it doesn't open.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Walk in the direction of the sound." icon="side.png" effect="kick_muted.mp3">
        As you get up, you hear a sound like a
        metallic impact, somewhere.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Keep walking.">
        It is frustratingly dark. Despite sleeping,
        you don't feel any more awake than before.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it." effect="kick.mp3">
        You hit your foot on something.
        That something...
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it more.">
        Solid metal.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Get up.">
        A handle? A hatch, you suppose.
        A raised bit with a hole- a lock.
        The hatch doesn't budge as you pull on the handle.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Walk toward the light." icon="side.png" effect="lightswitch_muted.mp3">
        As you get up, you hear a sound like a
        a switch being flipped, somewhere. A dim
        light can be seen in the distance.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Focus." icon="open.png">
        On the way, you catch a passing thought-
        How did you even get here? Where <i>is</i> here?
        Everything seems so formless and foreign. 
        Forget about a key- was there ever even
        a lock?
        </p>

        <p prompt="Pinch your arm for good measure." icon="blinking.gif">
        You squeeze your eyes closed hard and open them
        a few times.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Keep moving. Don't stagnate." icon="open.png">
        The most normal sensation so far.
        You might spend an eternity just
        standing around wherever you are,
        in this barely waking dream.
        Keep moving, don't stagnate.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Look for the door and window again.">
        Some time passes. The senses blur, as
        does any sense of progress-
        you feel like you're <i>literally</i>
        going nowhere.
        </p>

        <p prompt="...Whistle into the dark?">
        &quot;Looking&quot; may be a generous expression.
        You have other senses, surely?
        </p>

        <p prompt="This is stupid." effect="whistle.mp3">
        The sound echoes. You've learned you are
        not a bat.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Wait impatiently.">
        &lt; MOST RECENT POINT REACHED. &gt;
        </p>
