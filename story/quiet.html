        <p prompt="Look around.">
        Floating in an endless ocean,
        you awaken to a sense of unreality.
        You feel your way through the stillness.
        A dark fog permeates the air around you.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Approach the wall.">
        You look around in the dreamlike haze,
        for shape and structure. A wall. A door.
        A window with the curtains drawn.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Look outside.">
        You make your way to the wall and pause for a moment.
        The door and window are set in blue, wooden frames.
        </p>

        <p prompt="This feels wrong." prompt2="Step outside.">
        Out of the window, a serene, empty void.
        Out the door, a freezing comfort.
        An immense <i>absence</i>.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="...">
        The air feels painfully cold.
        It's as if the world ends beyond the threshold.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Go back.">
        There's nothing for you, there.
        There's nothing <i>there</i>.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Yawn.">
        You resist the curiosity and
        close the door.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Sleep.">
        Back inside, fatigue overwhelms you.
        </p>

        <p icon="closed.png" prompt="Wake up.">
        ...
        </p>

        <p icon="open.png" prompt="It's too dark.">
        You find yourself, once again, awake.
        Still, the senses blur and the lights feel dim.
        Dimmer than one would think possible. Despite sleeping,
        you don't feel any more awake than before.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Find more lights." prompt2="Explore the dark.">
        A couple bulbs illuminate part of the walls.
        You fail to make out any details of the space.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="What's this...?">
        Regardless of how ambiguous the space,
        you're still able to just trace your hand on the wall
        and-
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Crouch down to the light." effect="lightswitch.mp3">
        A switch on the wall. Flick it.
        A small light on the floor turns on.
        </p>
        
        <p id="branch1" prompt="Get up.">
        Next to the light, a metal hatch in the floor.
        On the hatch, a handle.
        Next to the handle, a lock.
        You try pulling, but it doesn't open.
        </p>

        <p id="branch1" prompt="Walk in the direction of the sound." icon="side.png" effect="kick_muted.mp3">
        As you get up, you hear a sound like a
        metallic impact, somewhere.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Keep walking.">
        The thin layer of illumination was barely
        helping, anyway. If you're to find something,
        it'll be pure luck regardless.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it." effect="kick.mp3">
        You hit your foot on something.
        That something...
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Feel it more.">
        Solid metal.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Get up.">
        A handle? A hatch, you suppose.
        A raised bit with a hole- a lock.
        The hatch doesn't budge as you pull on the handle.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" prompt="Walk toward the light." icon="side.png" effect="lightswitch_muted.mp3">
        As you get up, you hear a sound like a
        a switch being flipped, somewhere. A dim
        light can be seen in the distance.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Focus." icon="open.png">
        On the way, you catch a passing thought-
        How did you even get here? Where <i>is</i> here?
        Everything seems so formless and foreign. 
        Forget about a key- was there ever even
        a lock? It's hard to...
        </p>

        <p prompt="Pinch your arm for good measure." icon="blinking.gif">
        You squeeze your eyes closed hard and open them
        a few times.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Keep moving." icon="open.png">
        The most normal sensation so far.
        You might spend an eternity just
        standing around wherever you are,
        in this barely waking dream.
        Keep moving, don't stagnate.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Don't stagnate.">
        As you walk around, the dense sleeplike
        atmosphere presses down on you, depresses each
        thought, seeps into every glance and step you take.
        You hear a stray knocking sound once in a while.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Look for the door and window again.">
        Some time passes. The senses blur, as
        does any sense of progress-
        you feel like you're <i>literally</i>
        going nowhere.
        </p>

        <p prompt="...Whistle into the dark?">
        &quot;Looking&quot; may be a generous expression.
        You have other senses, surely?
        </p>

        <p prompt="This is stupid." effect="whistle.mp3">
        The sound echoes. Alas, lacking the finer points
        of being a bat, you're little better informed,
        save for the musical entertainment.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Close your eyes.">
        A little, but not as stupid as being &quot;literally&quot;
        nowhere, as you'd so eloquently put it.
        <br>...<br>
        A space. A door. A window. Possibly a hatch with a lock.
        Sleep and waking. Waking dreams and the slipping of time.
        You try and stay awake, but the overwhelming <i>thickness</i>
        of this dark prods at your senses, leads you away and...
        <br><br>
        You lay down.
        </p>

        <p icon="dream.gif" prompt="Dream." music="silent">
        Sleep and waking.
        </p>

        <p icon="shore_tile.png" music="dream.mp3" prompt="Okay.">
        A view of water and of a shore stretces out before you
        into the distance.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Okay.">
        The waves push... and they pull... They 
        undulate with a hypnotic rhythm.
        Back and forth.
        A calm... calm place. You are stranded with
        no way out. Nowhere, nowhere at all.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Okay.">
        The humming of the wind mixes with the sound
        of water beating against the shoreline at your feet.
        You might expect to hear a seagull, if you didn't feel
        so certain that there's nothing at all in this empty
        universe. Nothing but you, forever.
        </p>

        <p prompt="What...?" effect="knock_lightly.mp3">
        The humming of the wind- what's that? 
        ...The humming of the wind mixes with the sound
        of water beating at your feet.
        </p>

        <p prompt="...What was-">
        Peering into the pitch black nothing of the night sky,
        the water ahead reflects a moonless light.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Wake up." effect="knock_hard.mp3">
        Past the water-
        </p>

        <p icon="blinking.gif" background="preparation.png" color="#530000"
        music="preparation.mp3" styles="" prompt="This...">
        Awake, again. You blink. Hard. Something's off. Your
        heart beats faster than before. Uneasy. Anxious.
        <i>Decidedly</i> awake. You feel space itself pulsate under
        your feet. <i>Around</i> you.
        </p>

        <p icon="open.png" prompt="&quotI feel... awake.&quot">
        This place. You were exploring, before, but it didn't
        feel this way, then. It was like in a dream.
        The dark. It's so dark, but somehow
        it feels... less substantial. Thinner.
        </p>

        <p icon="side.png" prompt="Turn around.">
        Bizarre. Why are you here? It's been so strange, but
        you barely questioned it. In the corner of your vision,
        bright lights bounce across the space, impossible
        to ignore.
        </p>

        <p icon="spotlight_far.png" prompt="...">
        Spotlights...? From far above, somewhere.
        In the center of their focus... some kind of pedestal.
        You look around, but it doesn't seem like there's
        anything else, anymore. When you shout, there is no echo.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Walk around the structure.">
        You try to think of something hopeful, but the phrase
        &quot;like a moth to a flame&quot; is all that comes up.
        If there's a center of the world, it's right there.
        </p>

        <p prompt="Go to the center.">
        Nothing happens. You take a step sideways and yet
        keep facing the lights and the structure in the center.
        Radial symmetry. The world may as well be a single line passing
        from an infinite nowhere to the origin that is the pedestal.
        </p>

        <p icon="spotlight_near.png" prompt="Flip it." prompt2="Get away.">
        A switch. A strangely large one, at that.
        The whole thing stands at least eight feet tall.
        Foreboding, but not much of a choice.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" icon="open.png" prompt="Look back.">
        This doesn't feel right at all. You turn around and 
        take strides to get away, though assured you'll not get
        anywhere. One foot in front of the other until 
        you're all but running. Nothing forward, and the lights keep 
        shining from behind you.
        </p>

        <p id="branch2" icon="spotlight_near.png" prompt="Flick the switch.">
        What? You're certain you must've covered at least a couple 
        hundred yards. This doesn't make any sense...
        <br><br>
        What choice do you have?
        </p>

        styles="body=animation: next-room-bg 15s ease-in-out infinite"
        prompt="Look.">
        The world shakes apart with a massive sound and a feeling like
        falling in every direction. Vertigo spins you around.
        Shaken, but somehow alive, to your side, a familiar sight:
        The blue door and window that had previously lead nowhere.
        </p>
        
        <p icon="interior.png" prompt="Step outside.">
        Outside. You hear the sound of water and wind.
        A night sky spreads over the sandy landscape.
        For the first time, you know that this is <i>somewhere</i>,
        measurable and finite. The walls of the room stand solid,
        you, in the middle of it all.
